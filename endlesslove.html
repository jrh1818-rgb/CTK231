  My Love
  There's only you in my life
  The only thing that's right
  My first love
  You're every breath that I take
  You're every step
  <br>I make
  And I
  I want to share
  All my love with you
   <br>No one else will do
  And your eyes
  They tell me how much you care
  Oh yes, you will always be
  My endless love
  Two hearts
  <br>Two hearts that beat as one
  Our lives have just begun
  Forever
  I'll hold you close in my arms
  I can't resist your charms
  And love
  <br>I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
  You know I don't mind
  I don't mind
  'Cause you
  You mean the world to me
  <br>Oh, I know
  I've found in you
  My endless love
  Ooh, ah
  <br>Ooh, ah
  Ooh, ooh, ooh, and love
  I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
  You know I don't mind
  I don't mind
  And, yes, you'll be the only one
   <br>'Cause no one can deny
  This love I have inside
  I'll give it all to you
  My love, my love
  My endless love
  <br>Love, my endless love
  Oh, oh, oh my
  My, my, my, my endless love
  Ooh, ooh, my, my, my
  My love
  My endless love
