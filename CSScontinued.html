        The drums are loud! They are the loudest instrument and don't require electricity to play!
    </p>


    <p class="zeroout">Drums are used in cultures all over the world and appear in styles ranging from rock and jazz to hip-hop, orchestral music, and traditional ceremonial music.</p>
 
    <p class="zeroout">Drummers are often in high demand since solid rhythm players are harder to find than many other instrumentalists.</p>
 
    <p class="zeroout">Studying drums builds discipline, focus, and pattern recognition through regular practice. Most importantly, drums naturally make people move, and rhythm creates an immediate physical and emotional connection with listeners.</p>
